# Web Developer based in LA.

Originally from France, I now live with my family in Los Angeles, CA.
After a 15 year international career working in and running cocktail bars I decided to dive into my passion for all things tech and learned to code in 2020. My main focus is the Front End and I love to build beautiful, smooth interfaces and experiences in JavaScript, React and CSS.
